        <p class="description">
            Me, Cody Holland, Ethan Sanford, and Atmesh Acharya worked on a Spotify Integration with games for our Senior Capstone Project: <br><br>
            Using Spotify's Web API, we managed to make song requests in the user's behalf. <br>
            The goal was to help game developers by passing the cost to the user when it came to the game's soundtrack. <br><br>
            It was a long project, so I love looking back and comparing the end result with what we had 1 week in. <br>
            We planned on making a demo game to showcase song requests. That would require recognizing game events, like collisions. <br>
            The first thing we had to show for was a small box game written in JavaScript that recognizes collisions. <br>
            You can check it out by clicking the Demo button below, then compare it to the end result at: <br><br>
